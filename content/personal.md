# Personal

Before discovering the joys of computer science research, I was interested in philosophy. I represented India at the [International Philosophy Olympiad](https://www.philosophy-olympiad.org/), winning the silver medal. While I read and discuss philosophy much less than I used to, I am more than happy to subject any unlucky ear to my rehearsed spiels.

I also struggle to spell all sorts of words, even ones I use every day, and I spend most of my waking hours listening to music.
