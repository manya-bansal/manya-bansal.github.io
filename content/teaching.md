# Teaching

I was a course assistant for [CS140E: Operating Systems Design and Implementation](https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs140e-23win/) in Winter 2023.

I tutored mathematics undergraduates through the [Stanford University Mathematical Organization](https://sumo.stanford.edu/tutoring.html) for five math courses at Stanford University: linear algebra, multi-variable calculus, differential equations, applied matrix theory and proof-based matrix theory.

I tutored computer science undergraduates for introductory courses at Stanford University through [Black Lair](https://blackincs.stanford.edu/events-and-programming/black-lair).
